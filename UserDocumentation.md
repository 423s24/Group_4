## HRDC Maintenance Portal

- This is unique as it will improve accessibility to making a request for maintenance for those who struggle to do it due to the current system being so complicated. It will allow the user to request more simply.
- It is wanted to improve the quality in the process of getting a maintenance request sent to the man who runs the maintenance for the properties.

### How to Obtain:
